Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Lambda service.
Click on the "Create Function" button.
Select "Author from scratch" as the option.
Give your function a name, select the runtime environment as per your preference, and click on "Create Function".
Once your function is created, scroll down to the "Function code" section and paste the code for your API Gateway POST request.
Save your function.
Here's a sample code that you can use for your API Gateway POST request:

excute output only:
-------------------
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    body = {
        "message": "Hello, this is a POST request!"
    }
    
    response = {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "headers": {
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        "body": json.dumps(body)
    }
    
    return response
This code will return a response with a 200 status code and a JSON object containing a message "Hello, this is a POST request!" in the response body.

To integrate this Lambda function with API Gateway, follow these steps:

Go to the API Gateway service in the AWS Management Console.
Create a new API or select an existing one.
Add a new POST method to your API.
Select "Lambda Function" as the integration type and choose the Lambda function you just created.
Save your changes and deploy your API.
That's it! Your Lambda function is now integrated with API Gateway and can handle POST requests.




import json statement imports the JSON module to help with formatting the response.

def lambda_handler(event, context): defines the entry point for the AWS Lambda function.

body = {"message": "Hello, this is a POST request!"} creates a dictionary object with a key-value pair where key is "message" and value is "Hello, this is a POST request!".

response = { ... } creates a dictionary object with a key-value pairs to construct an HTTP response.

"statusCode": 200 indicates that the HTTP response status code is 200, which means that the request has been successfully processed.

"headers": {"Content-Type": "application/json"} sets the content type of the response to JSON.

"body": json.dumps(body) converts the dictionary object body to a JSON string using the json.dumps() method.

return response statement returns the response object as an HTTP response to the client that made the request.


code for entering manaul Value:
--------------------------------

import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    
    string=json.loads(event['body'])['string']
    
    message="Hello, this is a  {}".format(string)
    
    return message
